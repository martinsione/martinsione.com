Hopefully by the end of this post you should have reduced your bundle size. Note that this isn't for everybody, your app may use advanced react features which are not compatible with preact, if you want to learn more about the differences between preact and react, you can [read this](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/differences-to-react/) article from the official preactjs documentation.

## Let's get started

First you are going to need to install preact:

```bash
npm install preact
```

After you have installed go to `next.config.js` and add this:

```js {4-16}:next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
    // Replace React with Preact only in client production build
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      Object.assign(config.resolve.alias, {
        "react/jsx-runtime.js": "preact/compat/jsx-runtime",
        react: "preact/compat",
        "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
        "react-dom": "preact/compat",
      });
    }

    return config;
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

Now you should be able to run `npm run build` and see how your app bundle size has decreased
